# Information-Security-Malware
This Repo Contains the soucre code for the 3 Malware Assignments of the Information Secuirty
1. Assignment 1: 
  (10 Marks).
  a. Taking cues from the code provided for AbraWorm.py,turn the FooVirus.py virus into a worm by incorporating networking code in it.
  
  b.The resulting worm will stillinfect only the ‘.foo’ files , but it will also have the ability to hop into other machines.
  
2. Assignment 2:
(20 Marks).
Modify the code AbraWorm.py code so that no two copies of the worm are exactly the same in all of the infectedhosts at any given time.One way to accomplish this would be by inserting worm alteration code after the comment line that you see near the end of the main infinite loop in the script.Finally,deposit a copy of AbraWorm.py at the target host.BThis additional code in the worm could insert some extra newline characters between a randomly chosenset of lines ,some extra randomly selected characters in the comment blocks,some extra white space between the identifiers in each statement at randomly chosen places, and so on.
3. Assignment 3:
(20 Marks)
If you are ambitious, you can get the worm to modify it's code in more significant ways (without altering its overall logic). Ex – Changing the looping construct.
