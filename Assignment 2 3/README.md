This code will work best with Ubuntu 16.04 SEED Labs VMs connected together in a NAT Netwrok

## Dependencies:
    python2.7
    python-paramiko
    python-scp
## Installation setup
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y python-paramiko
    sudo apt-get install -y python-scp
## Running 
   1. Start two VMs- Attacker and Victim
   2. Configure the <i>IP address</i> , <i>username</i> to the vitcim IP address
   3. Copy  `mod.sh` & `mutate.sh` to /home/seed folder in the attacker
   4. Copy  `new.py` to /home/seed/Desktop folder in the attacker
   5. Execute on the Attacker machine `python new.py` to Launch the attack!
## Effects
   1.The Code will deposite itelf on the Traget machine under /home/seed/Desktop ✅.<br/>
   2.The Code will mutate  such that,command000 variable turns into command### with the help of mutate.sh ✅.<br/>
   3.The Code can bulk modifiy itself for example, the original for loops transforms into a while loop of similar functional logic with the help of mod.sh ✅.<br/>
   4.Two shell script files will remain on the victim machinne for furture "infections" (you can run python new.py again on the victim machine and face the above effects within the victim machine) ✅.<br/>
   5.The Code however, doesn't actively seek new victims  infect an entire Victim Network like a True worm ❌. at least not at  the momment .<br/>
